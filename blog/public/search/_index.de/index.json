[{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll set up a local serverless environment using AWS CDK, LocalStack, and a simple Python Lambda function. We\u0026rsquo;ll leverage the PythonFunction construct from the aws-cdk.aws-lambda-python-alpha module to simplify our Lambda deployment.\nThis local serverless setup offers several advantages for developers. By using AWS CDK with LocalStack, you can create and test AWS infrastructure and applications entirely on your local machine, without incurring any cloud costs. This approach allows for rapid prototyping, easier debugging, and faster development cycles. It\u0026rsquo;s particularly useful for developers who want to experiment with AWS services, test complex serverless architectures, or work in environments with limited internet connectivity. Moreover, this setup provides a consistent development environment across team members, reducing \u0026ldquo;it works on my machine\u0026rdquo; issues and facilitating smoother collaboration.\nPrerequisites Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:\nPython 3.7+ Node.js npm AWS CLI AWS CDK Docker Setting Up LocalStack LocalStack is a fully functional local AWS cloud stack. It allows you to develop and test your cloud applications offline.\nInstall LocalStack using pip:\npip install localstack Start LocalStack in detached mode:\nlocalstack start -d Installing awslocal and cdklocal awslocal is a lightweight wrapper that runs AWS CLI commands against LocalStack. Similarly, cdklocal allows you to deploy CDK applications to LocalStack.\nInstall awslocal:\npip install awscli-local Install cdklocal:\nnpm install -g aws-cdk-local Creating a Simple Echo Lambda Function Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\nmkdir localstack-cdk-demo cd localstack-cdk-demo Initialize a new AWS CDK project in Python:\ncdklocal init app --language python Create a directory for your Lambda function:\nmkdir lambda Inside the lambda directory, create a file named echo.py with the following content. We can simply echo whatever message is input.\ndef handler(event, context): message = event.get(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Hello from Lambda!\u0026#39;) return { \u0026#39;statusCode\u0026#39;: 200, \u0026#39;body\u0026#39;: message } Project Structure localstack-cdk-demo/ ├── .gitignore ├── README.md ├── app.py ├── cdk.json ├── lambda/ │ ├── requirements.txt │ └── echo.py ├── localstack_cdk_demo/ │ ├── __init__.py │ └── localstack_cdk_demo_stack.py ├── requirements-dev.txt ├── requirements.txt Why two requirements.txt? You might want to use lambda layers , but for the sake of simplicity, let\u0026rsquo;s put our requirements.txt in the lambda directory. The AWS CDK will automatically bundle your dependencies with the lambda deployment this way. If you know of a better way, please do reach out to me on GitHub!\nAdding Dependencies for Lambda Functions When working with Lambda functions, it\u0026rsquo;s often necessary to include external dependencies. To manage these dependencies efficiently, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a requirements.txt file in the lambda directory.\nCreate a file named requirements.txt in the lambda directory:\nDefining the Infrastructure with CDK First, add the aws-cdk.aws-lambda-python-alpha module to your requirements.txt file:\naws-cdk.aws-lambda-python-alpha Install the required Python packages:\npip install -r ./lambda/requirements.txt Now, open localstack_cdk_demo/localstack_cdk_demo_stack.py and replace its content with:\nfrom aws_cdk import ( Stack, aws_lambda as _lambda, aws_lambda_python_alpha as lambda_python, aws_apigateway as apigateway, ) from constructs import Construct class LocalstackCdkDemoStack(Stack): def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -\u0026gt; None: super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs) # Define the Lambda function using PythonFunction echo_lambda = lambda_python.PythonFunction( self, \u0026#39;EchoFunction\u0026#39;, entry=\u0026#39;lambda\u0026#39;, index=\u0026#39;echo.py\u0026#39;, # Optional if your main file is lambda_function.py handler=\u0026#39;handler\u0026#39;, runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_8, ) # Define the API Gateway REST API api = apigateway.LambdaRestApi( self, \u0026#39;EchoApi\u0026#39;, handler=echo_lambda, proxy=True ) The PythonFunction construct simplifies the process of defining Lambda functions by handling the packaging of your Python code and dependencies automatically.\nBootstrapping the CDK (Optional) If this is your first time deploying a CDK app to LocalStack, you may need to bootstrap the environment:\ncdklocal bootstrap Deploying to LocalStack Using CDK Install the required Python packages (if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already):\npip install -r requirements.txt Synthesize the CloudFormation template:\ncdklocal synth Deploy the stack:\ncdklocal deploy Confirm the deployment by typing y when prompted.\nTesting the Lambda via API Gateway Once deployed, you will receive an endpoint URL. You can test the Lambda function by sending a request to this URL.\nUse curl to send a POST request:\ncurl -X POST \u0026#39;http://localhost:4566/restapis/\u0026lt;api-id\u0026gt;/prod/_user_request_\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello, LocalStack!\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; Replace \u0026lt;api-id\u0026gt; with the API ID from your deployment output.\nYou should receive a response:\n{ \u0026#34;statusCode\u0026#34;: 200, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello, LocalStack!\u0026#34; } Conclusion You\u0026rsquo;ve successfully set up LocalStack, installed awslocal and cdklocal, created a simple Python Lambda function using the PythonFunction construct from the aws-cdk.aws-lambda-python-alpha module, mapped it to an API Gateway, and deployed it locally using the AWS CDK. This setup allows you to develop and test serverless applications entirely on your local machine.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/aws-localstack-cdk/","tags":["AWS","LocalStack","AWS Lambda","Docker","AWS CDK","Serverless"],"title":"Serverless Home Lab with AWS CDK, Lambda, and LocalStack"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
